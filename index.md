## About Me

I am a first-year master's student at Tongji University supervised by [Prof.Junqiao Zhao](http://cs1.tongji.edu.cn/~junqiao/). I am interested in reinforcement learning, LLM reasoning and embodied intelligence, with a focus on improving agent generalization in dynamic environments. Ultimately, I aim to build generalizable action models to enable intelligent and versatile robot behaviors.

## Research Interests

- **Reinforcement Learning:** model-based RL, offline RL
- **Large Language Model(LLM):** reasoning, RLHF
- **Emboddied AI:** Visual Prompt, DAgger
